# Hands-Gestures-detector-prototype

This project is a prototype for detecting hand gestures using computer vision techniques. It leverages machine learning models to recognize and classify various hand gestures in real time from video input.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and gesture recognition
- Support for multiple common gestures (e.g., thumbs up, peace sign)
- Easy-to-use interface for testing and demonstration

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OmarEssameldinMousa/Hands-Gestures-detector-prototype.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the prototype:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

## Project Structure
